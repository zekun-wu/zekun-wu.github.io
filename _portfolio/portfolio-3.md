- **Problem:** Visual highlights in GUIs are widely used but poorly understood in terms of how they shift user gaze behavior
- **What we built:** A saliency model (HISM) that incorporates both spatial and temporal gaze dynamics for GUI attention prediction
- **How it works:** GUI screenshots pass through spatial feature extraction and temporal modeling layers to predict where users will look
- **Why it matters:** Outperforms existing saliency models and provides actionable insights for user-centered interface design
- **Published:** [Read Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09695)
