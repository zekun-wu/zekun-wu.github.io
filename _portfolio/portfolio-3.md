## Overview

Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) often use visual highlights to guide user attention toward critical elements. In this project, we investigated the effects of these highlights on user gaze behavior in dynamic environments.

## Key Contributions

- Collected eye-tracking data in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios
- Developed HISM incorporating spatial and temporal aspects of gaze data
- Better prediction of attention shifts over time compared to existing saliency models
- Practical implications for designing more intuitive and user-centered interfaces

## Impact

HISM provides unique insights into how users interact with GUIs, revealing the benefits and potential trade-offs of visual highlights. The findings have practical implications for designing more intuitive and user-centered interfaces.
