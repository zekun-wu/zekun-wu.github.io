## Overview

This project investigates how subtle variations in AI-generated responses—such as the level of detail or confidence—can shape user beliefs in nuanced ways. While prior work often focuses on whether users accept or reject AI suggestions, we examined how these features influence both the stance and strength of user beliefs.

## Key Contributions

- Pre-registered experiment with 304 participants across fact-checking and opinion tasks
- Systematic variation of AI response detail and confidence tone
- Measurement of both stance direction and belief strength changes
- Practical insights for ethical LLM communication design

## Findings

Our findings show that responses with rich detail and moderate confidence were most effective in shifting beliefs. This work offers practical insights into how AI communication design can impact human judgment—raising both opportunities and ethical considerations for LLM-powered systems.
