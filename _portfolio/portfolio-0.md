## Overview

This project investigates how subtle variations in AI-generated responses—such as the level of detail or confidence—can shape user beliefs. We conducted a large-scale experiment to understand not just whether users accept AI suggestions, but how these features influence both the stance and strength of their beliefs.

## Key Contributions

- Pre-registered experiment with 304 participants across fact-checking and opinion tasks
- Systematically varied AI response detail (brief vs. rich) and confidence tone
- Measured both stance direction and belief strength changes
- Found that rich detail with moderate confidence is most effective in shifting beliefs
- Provides practical insights for ethical LLM communication design

## How It Works

Participants were shown claims on various topics and asked to indicate their initial beliefs. They then received AI-generated comments that varied in detail level and confidence tone, after which they reported their updated beliefs.
