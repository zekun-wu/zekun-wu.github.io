- **Problem:** Little is known about how subtle variations in AI responses influence the strength and direction of user beliefs
- **What we built:** A pre-registered experiment with 304 participants testing AI response detail and confidence tone across fact-checking and opinion tasks
- **How it works:** Participants received AI comments that varied in detail level (brief vs. rich) and confidence tone, then reported belief changes
- **Key finding:** Rich detail paired with moderate confidence is most effective at shifting user beliefs
- **Status:** Under review
