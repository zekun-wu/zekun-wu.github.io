- **Problem:** Young children need engaging, adaptive guidance during picture-book reading to develop literacy skills
- **What we built:** A webcam-based eye-tracking system paired with LLM-generated narrative prompts for interactive reading
- **How it works:** Gaze monitoring detects attention shifts on picture-book pages, then GPT-4 generates short, contextual story prompts
- **Why it matters:** Supports early literacy through curiosity-driven exploration without requiring adult intervention
- **Status:** Ongoing research project
