- **Problem:** Users often over-rely on or under-rely on AI suggestions in time-critical decision tasks
- **What we built:** A real-time gaze-based clustering model that classifies user reliance behavior and triggers calibrated interventions
- **How it works:** Eye-tracking metrics (fixation count, duration, revisits) feed an online clustering pipeline that distinguishes reliance patterns
- **Why it matters:** Enables systems to nudge users toward appropriate AI reliance through visual and audio prompts
- **Published:** ETRA 2025
