title: "Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM) for GUI Design"
excerpt: "This project explores how dynamic visual highlights influence user attention in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Using eye-tracking data, we analyzed temporal changes in gaze behavior across free-viewing and task-driven scenarios. Our novel Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM) integrates spatial and temporal data to predict attention shifts over time, outperforming existing models. These insights enable the design of more effective and user-focused GUIs.<br/><img src='/images/Model4.drawio.png'>"

Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) often use visual highlights to guide user attention toward critical elements. In this project, we investigated the effects of these highlights on user gaze behavior in dynamic environments. By leveraging eye-tracking data collected in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, we developed the Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM).

HISM incorporates spatial and temporal aspects of gaze data to better predict attention shifts over time compared to existing saliency models. It provides unique insights into how users interact with GUIs, revealing the benefits and potential trade-offs of visual highlights. The findings have practical implications for designing more intuitive and user-centered interfaces.
