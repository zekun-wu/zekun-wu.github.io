## Overview

AI assistance in time-critical tasks, such as drone monitoring, requires users to balance swift decision-making and proper verification of AI suggestions—what we term appropriate reliance. RelEYEance is a gaze-based clustering model designed to assess user reliance on AI in real-time.

## Key Contributions

- Identified fixation count, fixation duration, and revisits as key indicators of user reliance
- Distinguished between over-reliance, under-reliance, and appropriate reliance based on gaze metrics
- Implemented online clustering pipeline for real-time reliance detection
- Developed tailored interventions (visual and audio prompts) to recalibrate reliance

## Validation

The model was validated through experiments with different AI performance levels and demonstrated effectiveness in detecting reliance deviations and guiding users towards appropriate reliance.
