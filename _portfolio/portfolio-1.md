<p class="project-summary">
A gaze-based clustering model that assesses user reliance on AI in real-time during time-critical tasks like drone monitoring, enabling adaptive interventions to promote appropriate AI reliance.
</p>

<ul class="project-highlights">
  <li>Identified fixation count, duration, and revisits as key reliance indicators</li>
  <li>Distinguishes over-reliance, under-reliance, and appropriate reliance patterns</li>
  <li>Implements online clustering pipeline for real-time detection</li>
  <li>Delivers visual and audio interventions to recalibrate user behavior</li>
</ul>
