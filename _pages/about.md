I'm a Ph.D. student working at the [Computational Interaction Lab](https://www.cilab.org/), Saarland University. My current research interest is mainly focused on analyzing and predicting users' fixations when interacting with interfaces. Before moving to Germany, I also had research experience in human reliability analysis and data visualization.
