I'm a Ph.D. student working at the [Computational Interaction Lab](https://cix.cs.uni-saarland.de/), Saarland University, Germany. My research focuses on analyzing and predicting user fixations during interactions with interfaces. I also have prior research experience in human reliability analysis and data visualization.
